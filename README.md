# hotel-full-stack
To run the project, you need to run both the frontend and backend.

## Frontend
To run the frontend, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, navigate to the frontend directory and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the frontend server and open it in your default web browser.

## Backend
To run the backend, you need to have maven and Springboot installed. Then, navigate to the backend directory and run the following commands:

```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the backend server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000.

You can now access the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:3000/hotels in your web browser.
